A grab‑bag of scripts, API examples, and notes across work and projects.

## Folders

- `integrations/` — DTCC/Bloomberg Eikon automation, HCL Domino/Notes odds & ends.
- `honeybeard/` — formulas & notes.
- `snippets/` — tiny one‑off examples.

## How to use
Each folder has its own README or inline comments. PRs welcome if you’re future‑me.
